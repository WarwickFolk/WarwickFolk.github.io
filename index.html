    <h2>A little introduction...</h2>
    <h3>Who are we?</h3>
    <p>
      We are a collection of musicians, dancers, and generally curious
      individuals who appreciate the various folk traditions that exist in
      Britain and beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
      All are welcome - whether you are a seasoned attendee of ceilidhs, an
      instrumentalist looking to branch out or just generally looking for
      something that is both new and traditional, Warwick Folk is here for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      No experience needed (fun fact I had never played folk before coming to
      university and knew very little about British folk culture but the society
      provided a lovely relaxed insight into a really fun tradition).
    </p>
    <h3>What we do?</h3>
    <p>
      We play and dance to a large array of traditional folk music and perform
      live throughout the year. We also periodically host Ceilidhs for all to
      join in the fun.
    </p>
    <p>This is what we sound like...</p>

    <h3>What do we stand for? (i.e. society constitution)</h3>
    <p>
      Warwick Folk is an inclusive society that seeks to ensure the enjoyment of
      all its members. All skill levels are welcome and will be accommodated. We
      endeavour to provide the best conditions for sharing the folk traditions.

    <h2>Learning about Folk</h2>
    <h3>Types of tunes</h3>
    <p>
      Generally, folk tunes are defined by the kinds of dances they are set to.
      Thus, all the tunes we play are also terms for kinds of traditional folk
      dance.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Reels</b>: A term which refers to a tune in simple metre. These tunes
        are very diverse but are generally pretty understandable for a newcomer.
      </li>
      <li><b>Polkas</b>: Often have swing feel to them and are played fast.</li>
      <li>
        <b>Jigs</b>: A lively and bouncy type of tune most often associated with
        Ireland often calls for an energetic dance.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Slip Jigs</b>: Similar feel to a jig, but is played in 9/8, giving it
        an uneven quality.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Hornpipes</b>: A type of tune/dance most often associated with
        sailors and is typically with an uneven feel.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Waltzes</b>: Played in 3/4 (counted in threes). Generally played
        fairly slowly and can often be played quite expressively.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Mazurkas</b>: Also played in 3/4. Often livelier than a waltz and
        with the second or third beats accented (as opposed to the usual
        accented first beat).
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Slides</b>: Played in 12/8. Slides have a similar feel to jigs, but
        with more flowing melodies.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Playfords</b>: A collection of tunes and dances written by John
        Playford, who attempted to bring folk dancing to the higher classes in
        the 1650s.
      </li>
    </ul>
